## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Prescription & Onboarding

1. **Clinician Referral:** The doctor introduces the system during therapy and provides a unique code or link for app access ([Google AI for Developers][1]).
2. **User Registration:** Secure sign-up with minimal friction; collects baseline metrics (e.g., GAD-7 for anxiety or PCL-5 for PTSD) ([syscreations.com][2]).
3. **Initial Calibration:** Conversation Agent runs a brief intake to gauge mood, symptom severity, and preferences, storing data for personalization ([arXiv][3]).

### 1.2 Core Agents & Roles

| Agent                            | Responsibility                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conversation Agent**           | Conducts daily check-ins, uses LLM to provide empathetic dialogue and motivational support ([Google AI for Developers][1]).                                          |
| **Task Agent**                   | Issues CBT, DBT, mindfulness or exposure-therapy tasks; schedules reminders; adjusts difficulty ([PMC][4]).                                                          |
| **Tracking Agent**               | Logs task completion, tracks sentiment shifts via NLP, visualizes progress trends for user and clinician ([syscreations.com][2]).                                    |
| **Crisis Detection Agent** (new) | Monitors conversations and tracking data for self-harm cues or severe distress; escalates to clinician or emergency protocols ([Confinity ‚Äì  Cherished Forever][5]). |

## 2. The Additional Agent: Crisis Detection

### 2.1 Why It‚Äôs Essential

* **Safety Net:** Detects suicidal ideation, panic attack signals, or trauma flashbacks in user messages ([Confinity ‚Äì  Cherished Forever][5]).
* **Timely Escalation:** Automatically notifies the clinician dashboard or crisis hotline integration upon high-risk flags ([Teen Vogue][6]).
* **Continuous Learning:** Refines detection models with clinician-verified instances to reduce false positives/negatives over time ([PMC][7]).

### 2.2 Core Functions

1. **Language Analysis:** Employ both keyword and transformer-based sentiment classifiers.
2. **Physiological Data Integration (optional):** Monitor wearables (heart rate spikes) for adjunctive evidence of panic or distress ([syscreations.com][2]).
3. **Escalation Protocols:** On red-flag detection, pause standard interactions and route user to immediate help options, clinician chat, or emergency services.

## 3. Step-by-Step Roadmap

### Phase 1: Design & Prototyping

* **a. Define Use Cases & Safety Requirements:** Collaborate with mental-health experts to codify task libraries and crisis criteria ([PMC][7]).
* **b. Architect Agent Workflows:** Map out inter-agent communication flows (e.g., when Tracking Agent flags low adherence, Task Agent adjusts tasks) ([SuperAnnotate][8]).
* **c. Select Frameworks:** Leverage Google ADK for orchestration, Vertex AI for model hosting, and LangChain or Microsoft Autogen for agent tooling ([Home- Google Developers Blog][9]) ([Stream][10]).

### Phase 2: Development with Google ADK

* **a. Agent Definition:** Use ADK‚Äôs API to register each agent‚Äôs capabilities, input/output schemas, and tool-access permissions ([Home- Google Developers Blog][9]).
* **b. Orchestration Pipeline:** Implement a state machine where ADK routes messages/events among agents based on triggers and priorities.
* **c. Tool Integrations:** Connect external services‚Äîcalendar APIs for reminders, secure databases for logs, clinician dashboards

### Phase 3: Testing & Clinical Validation

* **a. Internal Beta:** Conduct usability testing with clinicians and a small patient cohort to refine dialogue flows and task relevance ([WSJ][12]).
* **b. Safety Trials:** Validate Crisis Detection thresholds against real-world chat logs, ensuring minimal false alarms and high recall ([Confinity ‚Äì  Cherished Forever][5]).
* **c. Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure HIPAA/GDPR compliance, secure data encryption, and informed consent processes.

### Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring

* **a. Cloud Deployment:** Containerize agents and deploy via Vertex AI or Kubernetes for scalability ([Home- Google Developers Blog][9]).
* **b. User Rollout:** Staged release starting with supervised clinical settings, followed by wider patient onboarding.
* **c. Real-Time Monitoring:** Dashboards for clinician oversight showing user engagement, task adherence, and crisis flags ([Teen Vogue][6]).

### Phase 5: Iteration & Scaling

* **a. Data-Driven Improvements:** Retrain language models and update task libraries based on user outcomes and clinician feedback ([Medium][13]).
* **b. New Agents:** Consider adding a **Social Skills Coach Agent** for role-play simulations or a **Peer Support Agent** to connect users with moderated group chats ([Medium][11]).
* **c. Ecosystem Expansion:** Integrate wearables, voice/video analysis, or AR exposure modules for PTSD treatment ([PMC][4]).

## 4. Key Considerations & Best Practices

* **Evidence-Based Content:** Anchor tasks in proven therapies (CBT, DBT, mindfulness) to maintain clinical efficacy ([PMC][4]).
* **Ethical Oversight:** Establish an ethics board and transparent data-use policies to build trust and mitigate bias ([Financial Times][14]).
* **Human-in-the-Loop:** Always allow clinicians to override agent suggestions and review flagged incidents ([WSJ][12]).
* **User Engagement:** Gamify progress with badges/rewards to improve adherence, leveraging behavioral-science insights ([Medium][13]).
