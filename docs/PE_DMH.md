# üß† Prompt Engineering (PE) for Digital Mental Health (DMH)

## üìò Introduction

This guide outlines effective **Prompt Engineering (PE)** methods specifically tailored for applications in **Digital Mental Health (DMH)**. It highlights state-of-the-art techniques and models that enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in detecting, understanding, and supporting mental health scenarios.

## üìå 1. Types of Prompt Engineering

### üîπ N-Shot Prompting

**N-shot prompting** is an NLP method where LLMs are provided with *N* examples within the prompt to guide them in performing a task.

* **Zero-shot prompting** involves no examples‚Äîonly task instructions. It's useful for straightforward tasks like:

  * Information retrieval

  * Language translation

  * Question answering

  > üìå *Example*: ChatGPT has shown success in zero-shot depression and suicide risk detection.

* **Few-shot prompting** involves 2‚Äì5 task-specific examples. It's better suited for complex or domain-specific tasks such as:

  * Mental health question answering

  * Custom text generation

  > üß™ *Example Models*: **Mental-RoBERTa**, **Mental-FLAN-T5** used for classifying depression, stress, and suicidal ideation.

### üîπ Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting

**CoT prompting** enhances the **reasoning capabilities** of LLMs by breaking down complex problems into intermediate reasoning steps.

* Encourages **multi-step thinking** and **explanation generation**
* Improves mental health assessments by providing more explainable AI output

> üß† *Key Studies*:

* **Kojima et al.**: Enhanced GPT-3.5/4 reasoning in mental health tasks
* **Englhardt et al.**: Used time-series data for depression/anxiety detection
* **Wang et al.**: Multi-step CoT frameworks for mental state assessment
* **Chen et al.**: Introduced *Diagnosis of Thought* prompting to detect cognitive distortions

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note*: While CoT improves explainability, its effectiveness still depends heavily on **prompt quality**.

## üõ†Ô∏è 2. Methods of Prompt Engineering

### üî∏ 2.1 In-Context Learning (ICL)

ICL allows LLMs to learn **new, semantically similar tasks** from a few examples in the prompt‚Äîwithout retraining.

* **Inspired by human knowledge transfer**
* Uses **demonstrations** to adapt to new tasks

> üß™ *Applications*:

* **Hayati et al.**: Used few-shot ICL for depression detection
* **Su et al.**: Introduced a new ICL reasoning framework
* **Fu et al.**: Commonsense-based generation for mental health support
* **GoodTimes App**: Used ICL in reminiscence therapy

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Limitations*:

* Struggles with **contextually dissimilar** tasks
* Limited generalization and lack of structural context

---

### üî∏ 2.2 Prompt Tuning (PT)

**Prompt Tuning** introduces **soft continuous prompts** (learnable vectors) that fine-tune prompt inputs while keeping most of the LLM frozen.

> üìå *Highlights*:

* Improves domain adaptation and context retention
* Better than ICL and CoT in many DMH scenarios

> üß™ *Key Contributions*:

* **Blair et al.**: Used few-shot PT for mental health news
* **Li et al.**: Optimization + reinforcement learning in GPT-4
* **Spathis et al.**: Temporal stress level inference using zero-shot PT

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Challenges*:

* Harder to scale
* Needs careful optimization
* Lacks generalization for unfamiliar contexts

---

### üî∏ 2.3 Instruction Prompt Tuning

An advanced variant of PT that focuses on **instruction-style soft prompts** optimized to guide LLM behavior effectively for specific domains like mental health.

> üß™ *Key Contributions* (Same as PT):

* **Li et al.**, **Blair et al.**, **Spathis et al.** highlighted strong performance in:

  * Suicidal ideation detection
  * Cognitive distortion assessment

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Challenges*:

* Same as PT: complex tuning, context limitations, and generalization hurdles
